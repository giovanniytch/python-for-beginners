# what is a variable?
# - it is a container or box, with a label, in which you can store data.

# example: a variable called 'mynum' with the data 20 stored in it.
mynum = 20
print(mynum)

# '=' is called the assignment operator.
# it stores data that is to the right of the assignment operator
# into the variable that is to the left of the assignment operator.

# exercises:
# a) declare a variable called 'myname' and store your name in it.
# b) print the variable called 'myname' to the terminal.
